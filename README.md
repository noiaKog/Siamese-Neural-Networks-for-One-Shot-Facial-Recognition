# Siamese-Neural-Networks-for-One-Shot-Facial-Recognition
This project explores the application of **Siamese Neural Networks to solve a one-shot image recognition** task using a facial image dataset. The goal is to determine whether two face images depict the same person, even if that person was not part of the training set.

One-shot learning addresses real-world challenges where labeled examples per class are scarce. Unlike traditional classification methods that rely on many examples, one-shot learning builds the ability to generalize from just one or a few samples. This has practical applications in facial authentication, security, and verification systems.

## Problem Statement
Given a pair of facial images:
- Predict whether they represent the **same individual** or different people.
Key characteristics:
- No identity overlap between training and testing
- The model must **generalize to unseen identities**
- Training uses **contrastive loss** to learn a meaningful embedding space

## Dataset

- Name: Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW-a version)
- Content: Aligned facial images of various individuals
- Structure: Pre-divided into train and test sets with non-overlapping identities
- Task: Create image pairs (positive and negative) for training and evaluation

## Model Architecture

This project implements a **Siamese Neural Network** consisting of:

- Two identical CNN branches (sharing weights) to extract feature embeddings from images
- Distance metric: Euclidean distance between image embeddings
- Loss Function: Contrastive loss with margin

## Components:

- Convolutional layers with ReLU activations
- Batch normalization for stability
- Fully connected layers to produce low-dimensional embeddings
- Embedding comparison via distance-based decision

## Implementation Details

- Framework**: PyTorch
- Optimizer: Adam / SGD (varied for comparison)
- Hyperparameters: Batch size, learning rate, margin â€“ tuned experimentally
- Data split: Optional validation set used during training
- Training strategy: Early stopping based on validation performance
